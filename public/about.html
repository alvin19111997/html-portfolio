<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a skilled software engineer with a BTech in Software Engineering and growing expertise in full stack web development. With a solid technical background in machine learning, I have conducted in-depth research on adversarial textures, focusing on developing adaptive multi-scale solutions to evade person detection systems. My work combines advanced algorithms with real-world testing, demonstrating my ability to innovate and tackle complex technical challenges. Currently, I am expanding my skillset through a comprehensive Udemy course in full stack development, preparing to take on diverse web-based projects.</p>

<p>Beyond my technical expertise, I have a strong commitment to personal growth. I dedicate time to studying religious texts, including the Psalms and Watchtower publications, which helps me maintain a balanced perspective in life. This spiritual engagement allows me to bring fresh ideas and resilience to my work, enhancing my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
